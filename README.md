**🏠 Hostel Complaint Management System**
The Hostel Complaint Management System is a web-based application designed to digitize and streamline the complaint handling process in hostel environments. The system enables students to raise complaints online, wardens to manage and resolve issues, and administrators to monitor and supervise the entire complaint lifecycle.
The platform ensures transparency, accountability, and structured communication between students and hostel authorities. It also includes an escalation mechanism where administrators can send warning emails if complaints remain unresolved.
**💡 Solution**
This system provides a centralized web application where:
Students can submit complaints with descriptions and proof images.
Wardens can update and resolve complaints.
Administrators can monitor complaint statistics and send escalation warnings.
Email notifications are sent using SMTP integration.
Complaint delay is tracked using timestamp comparison.
For demonstration purposes, delay tracking is calculated in minutes (1 minute = 1 day simulation).
